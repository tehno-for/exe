        <p>Great review! I had a blast on the West side of the loop last week. I found a hidden gem in the old orchard field past the “Lazy S” spur. If you keep going past the trail marker, you’ll find a fantastic run through a dried up gulley-wash. Just stay clear of it on rainy days.</p>

    <h3>Los Robles Trail</h3>
    <p>by Danny Keys</p>
    <p>submitted on 06/26/14</p>
    <p>My buddies and I had heard about this trail in November from a friend who had finished the West portion earlier in the month. It sounded like a good trail, but we didn't have time to check it out until last week.</p>

    <h3>Ojai Trail Facts</h3>
    <p>Ojai has over 200 miles of hiking and biking trails, with over 80 miles dedicated solely to mountain biking! Most trails border working farms or ranches, so please take the time to learn your route before going, and pay careful attention to trail markers. Ojai trails are mostly self maintained, so if you see a problem, try to fix it! If the problem is a large one, contact one of the local cycling clubs to let them know,each month they have a trail-repair day that is spent maintaining the trails you know and love!</p>

    <h3>Copper Canyon Loop</h3>
    <p>by Shea Hansen </p>
    <p>submitted on 04/30/14</p>
    <p>I’m going to be the first to admit, I don’t like technical climbs, and I don’t consider myself a good climber. That’s why, when my friend Heather asked me to go with her to the Copper Canyon Loop, or the “Coop” as it’s called, I hesitated. I’ve heard horror stories about the boulder climbs, poorly marked trails, and lack of trail upkeep. </p>
