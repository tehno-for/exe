It works on my machine.
It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.
How hard can it be?
How did that even work in the first place?
I don’t see anything in the logs.
I’m guessing it’s an issue on their side.
Probably some kind of permissions issue.
That’s weird.
That’s a known issue.
We don’t support that.
No, I don’t know how long it’s going to take.
Actually, it has always been like that.
Have you tried it with Chrome or Firefox?
It should work now.
But that’s not how you told me it should work.
Well there’s your problem right there.
Working as intended.
I mean, everything’s *possible*…
That will never happen.
Shouldn’t take too long.
Cheap, fast, high quality. Pick any two.
It’s 90% done.
This is just a temporary fix
You’re doing it wrong
That’s a code smell.
I thought we fixed this!
Yes, but does it scale?
Foobar: out of working order; seriously, perhaps irreparably, damaged.
Grok: understand (something) intuitively or by empathy.
Rabbit hole: Nonsensical process of getting from Point A to Point B with no clear route (and often no recollection) on how one got there.
Yak shaving: Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing you to overcome intermediate difficulties, allows you to solve a larger problem.
Bikeshedding: Futile investment of time and energy in discussion of marginal technical issues.
Automagically: In an automagical manner; happening seemingly without effort.
Performant: Capable of or characterized by an adequate or excellent level of performance or efficiency
